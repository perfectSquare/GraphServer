In the dining room, there is a large dinner table with room for up to 12 persons. Currently, we can unfortunately not offer bedsheets, since we live in Stockholm and do not have the opportunity to do washing between guest stays.<br><br>On Linnéaholmen, there are two dug canals which are inspired by Venice. Apart from the big house, there is also a sauna house with a shower and relax room, as well as a magnificent panorama over Storsjön. Accompanying the sauna house is a large patio with a table for the lovely summer dinners by the water. It also has a ladder to the sea if you want to go for a swim. We can also offer access to a canoe during your stay at Linnéaholmen.<br><br>On the island, there is also an old-fashioned baking house, which mainly has been used for the local craft of baking thin-bread.
