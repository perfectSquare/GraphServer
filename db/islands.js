In the dining room, there is a large dinner table with room for up to 12 persons.

Apart from the big house, there is also a sauna house with a shower and relax room, as well as a magnificent panorama over Storsjön. Accompanying the sauna house is a large patio with a table for the lovely summer dinners by the water. It also has a ladder to the sea if you want to go for a swim. We can also offer access to a canoe during your stay at Linnéaholmen.<br><br>On the island, there is also an old-fashioned baking house, which mainly has been used for the local craft of baking thin-bread.

Enjoy the benefits of a new wooden grill and the soft steam of a log sauna, backed by a Harvia Legend stove with 120 kg of stones. Dip into the cooling embrace of the Baltic Sea from the private sandy beach and feel the miraculous effect of rainwater on your hair. Days go by relaxing on the sun lounger or on the Mutku rowing boat around the island. Why not have a picnic on some deserted island next door? Children wonder about the beach-eating swans and the gulls and terns that glide in the sky. You might spot a grey stork, a sea eagle, a fox, a moose or a deer. Outdoor games can be found in the warehouse. In the rain, entertainment is provided by Wi-Fi, TV, board games, fitness equipment and a mini library. Stare into the fire of the fireplace, into the flame of the candle and get inspired. The sea-climate's tasty night's sleep is enjoyed in the guesthouse, decorated in the style of a log sauna in the Wild West. The smallest in the family reserve a cottage top bed. Even a nap on a hammock. If you want to expand your territory, take a boat to the island restaurants of Odine or the St.Petersburg Sailing Club. Book a trip to Isokari lighthouse island. Uusikaupunki beach restaurants and all other services are also just a short sea trip away, where we offer boat trips. There are two cottages on the island, a treehouse, a treehouse, two docks, a barbecue grill, an open air church, a rowboat, and a 2-3 person tent. There's no running water. The hostess provides drinking water. Laundry is in the sea and in the rain. In the sauna, the water heats up in the pot. The main cabin has solar power and a functional, compact kitchen, with hand-dishwashing. Cottages heat with wood-burning fireplaces. A chance to rent a boat for an additional four person stay. The renter will bring sheets and towels, or they can be rented for an additional cost. We also offer yoga, laughter yoga, dining, sauna heating, fire nights in archipelago music, food, and stories, and various boat tours as program services.

Länsipuolella emme suosittele kahlaamista: mahdollisia lasinsiruja.<br>Merivedessä saattaa olla sinilevää kuumana aikana: vaarallista eläimille ja lapsille.<br>Punkkeja saaren itäosan ruohikoissa.<br>Ei sovellu liikuntaesteisille.<br>Vuokraaja vastaa loppusiivouksesta tai ostaa sen 80 euron hintaan. Ei sisällä tiskausta.<br>Pesu meri- ja sadevedellä: Kuivana kautena sadeveden käyttöä rajattava minimiin. Tämä ei ole luxuskohde kaikilla mukavuuksilla, mutta jos sinulla on seikkailu- ja erähenkeä, nautit taatusti lomastasi autiolla saarella!"
