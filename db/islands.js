We can also offer access to a canoe during your stay at Linnéaholmen.<br><br>On the island, there is also an old-fashioned baking house, which mainly has been used for the local craft of baking thin-bread.

Sit out on the deck for a glass, breathe, be there, and let your eyes rest at one of the most stunning sunsets in the archipelago. Feel the warmth of the rock beneath your bare toes. Enjoy the benefits of a new wooden grill and the soft steam of a log sauna, backed by a Harvia Legend stove with 120 kg of stones. Dip into the cooling embrace of the Baltic Sea from the private sandy beach and feel the miraculous effect of rainwater on your hair. Days go by relaxing on the sun lounger or on the Mutku rowing boat around the island. Why not have a picnic on some deserted island next door? Children wonder about the beach-eating swans and the gulls and terns that glide in the sky. You might spot a grey stork, a sea eagle, a fox, a moose or a deer. Outdoor games can be found in the warehouse. In the rain, entertainment is provided by Wi-Fi, TV, board games, fitness equipment and a mini library. Stare into the fire of the fireplace, into the flame of the candle and get inspired. The sea-climate's tasty night's sleep is enjoyed in the guesthouse, decorated in the style of a log sauna in the Wild West. The smallest in the family reserve a cottage top bed. Even a nap on a hammock. If you want to expand your territory, take a boat to the island restaurants of Odine or the St.Petersburg Sailing Club. Book a trip to Isokari lighthouse island. Uusikaupunki beach restaurants and all other services are also just a short sea trip away, where we offer boat trips. There are two cottages on the island, a treehouse, a treehouse, two docks, a barbecue grill, an open air church, a rowboat, and a 2-3 person tent. There's no running water. The hostess provides drinking water. Laundry is in the sea and in the rain. In the sauna, the water heats up in the pot. The main cabin has solar power and a functional, compact kitchen, with hand-dishwashing. Cottages heat with wood-burning fireplaces. A chance to rent a boat for an additional four person stay. The renter will bring sheets and towels, or they can be rented for an additional cost. We also offer yoga, laughter yoga, dining, sauna heating, fire nights in archipelago music, food, and stories, and various boat tours as program services. Request a program selection and an offer customized from your group hostess!"

Pulahda vilvoittavaan Itämeren syleilyyn privaatilta hiekkarannalta ja tunne sadeveden ihmeitä tekevä vaikutus hiuksiisi. Päivät kuluvat rennosti aurinkotuolilla loikoillen tai vaikkapa Mutku-soutuveneellä saarta kiertäen. Miksipä et lähtisi piknikille johonkin autioon naapurisaareen. Lapset ihmettelevät rannassa syöviä joutsenia ja taivaalla liitäviä lokkeja ja tiiroja. Saatatpa bongata harmaahaikaran, merikotkan, ketun, hirven tai peurankin. Varastosta löytyy ulkopelejä. Sateella viihteen takaa Wi-Fi, televisio, lautapelit, kuntoiluvälineet ja minikirjasto. Tuijottele kaminan tuleen, kynttilän liekkiin ja inspiroidu. Meri-ilmaston makoisista yöunista nautitaan hirsisaunan villin lännen tyyliin sisustetussa vierastuvassa. Perheen pienimmät varaavat mökin yläsängyn. Maistuupa päiväunetkin riippumatossa.

Myös Uudenkaupungin rantaravintolat ja kaikki muut palvelut ovat vain lyhyen merimatkan päässä, johon tarjoamme veneretkiä. Saaressa on kaksi mökkiä, puuvaja, puucee, kaksi laituria, grilli, savustin, ulkoilmakirkko, soutuvene ja 2-3 hlö teltta. Juoksevaa vettä ei ole. Emäntä toimittaa juomaveden. Pesu tapahtuu meressä ja sadevedellä. Saunassa vesi lämpiää padassa. Päämökissä on aurinkosähköt ja toimiva, kompakti keittiö, tiskaus käsin. Mökit lämpenevät puilla lämmitettävillä kaminoilla. Mahdollisuus vuokrata vene neljän hengen lisämajoitukseen. Vuokraaja tuo lakanat ja pyyhkeet tai voi vuokrata ne lisämaksusta. Tarjoamme myös ohjelmapalveluina mm. joogaa, naurujoogaa, ruokailuja, saunan lämmitystä, nuotioiltoja saaristomusiikin, -ruoan, ja -tarinoiden parissa ja erilaisia veneretkiä.

The villas are named after popular local flowering plants, trees and birds.<br>The villas are furnished with antiques, including some beautifully carved and crafted doors and windows, which were meticulously collected over a period of time. TV and a land-line telephone are available at our residence, whilst ceiling fans assure a cooling circulation of air at all times.<br>We have installed air-conditioners within the cottages for your comfort. An Internet facility through Wi-Fi is available free of cost to the guests. The signal can be best accessed from our porch area, the sitting room and the waterside jetty.<br>There is a refrigerator and an electric kettle in each room with tea and coffee making provisions. The villas are well furnished with two large single beds, wardrobe, cupboard, writing table, and chair, settees, and chairs in the ‘sit-out’. There is a clean, dry and spacious bathroom in each villa. Extra beds are available if needed, and there is also a generator to backup the electricity in case of a power failure. All windows are netted to check the entry of insects.<br>There are plenty of doors and windows in each villa (18 windows and 8 doors) which open on to the farm, garden and backwaters, allowing for excellent circulation of fresh breezes and fascinating views from within. This is in keeping with the tradition of typical backwater bungalows. The idea has been to make each villa an integral part of the surroundings so that by living in one you are not cut off from nature, but feel at one with the beautiful environment.<br>The floor is finished in rustic clay tiles and the ceiling in wood. There is also a small verandah finished in traditional red-oxide which runs around each villa.<br>To complement the villas, there is a beautiful thatched pavilion on stilts, overlooking the farm with views of the backwaters. The pavilion opens on to a small, neat courtyard under an old mango tree. Most communally served meals are served in this delightful setting. We are also delighted to announce the completion of our new ‘jetty’- a covered pavilion built on the quayside where you can sit, admire the stunning views, watch the occasional houseboat glide by or just relax and soak up your surroundings and feel the cooling breezes from the nearby lake.In designing the villas, we kept in mind all the traditional features, but also the fact that we were designing a house where you would feel at home, and not a typical hotel room with its sterile, uniform, contrived atmosphere. When all this is combined with the traditional, homely hospitality, you might just think that it is your second home."

                "desc": "Food : All meals are included in the price<br><br><br>Food is definitely one of the highlights of staying at Philipkuttys farm. The cuisine is mostly local and cooked by my skillful mother-in-law. Being a traditional agrarian household, lavish meals are more or less the norm and pretty much a way of life. All meals are included in the price, including complementary bottled water in the cottages.<br>Meals are served communally, either in the family dining room or outdoors in the thatched pavilion. We are glad to cater for any special diets if needed and also provide for vegetarian options too. When time permits we also love to join you around the communal table.<br>We also cater for lunch parties for non resident guests but only by prior arrangement. We also offer cookery demonstrations for resident guests who are interested in learning the local cuisine, or we can always offer a more ‘hands-on’ experience if you prefer..<br>The cuisine is predominantly Syrian Christian with a strong backwater influence. Most of the dishes served are centered around fish, farm vegetables and fruits, duck, chicken and occasionally other meats, supplemented with rice and rice based local breads like appam, string hoppers etc. Some of our specialities are Karimeen (pearlspot), fish fry, fish molee, prawn and scampi preparations, duck roast and curry, and red hot Kerala fish curry to name a few.<br>Breakfast consists of several components. We serve toast with home-made jams, farm-made yoghurt with fresh fruits and local honey and eggs prepared to your preference are always available. There is also an Indian component which may be sweet or savoury, such as dhosas served with chutney, sweet or savoury pancakes and similar tasty delights.Desserts are usually puddings, fresh fruits and some local treats. Coffee and tea are served after breakfast and lunch."
