It is a self-catered house but on your request meals can be arranged.<br>The beach house is completely renovated and decorated to a high standard. We have used quality bed linen and towels to ensure your stay is comfortable. We provide beach towels to avoid heavy suitcases!<br><br>The Blue Peacock Beach House is a staffed property: Part time Property manager, housekeeping and no extra electricity charge in standard rental rate. *** (see below). We also offer high-speed WIFI ** (see below)<br><br>Please Note: As Sri Lanka is developing country, the government can implement power cuts. This also affects Hikkaduwa and the Blue Peacock Beach House * (see below)<br><br>The Blue Peacock Beach House is a private - self catered – residence. If you would like breakfast, lunch and dinner this can be arranged at your request. Prices depend on your personal preferences and wishes ( meat, fish, shell fish, vegetarian, BBQ etc. etc).<br>Our staff will do their best to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The manager can also arrange sightseeing and tours on request in our own luxury van. Please note that this self-catered house is not staffed 24/7.<br><br>Rooms will be cleaned and beds made every day. Linens/Towels changed every 3 days.<br><br>There are 3 air-conditioned cosy bedrooms with ceiling fans. All rooms have extra long traditional Sri Lankan 4-poster beds with brand new matrasses and mosquito nets.<br>We have one double room and two twin rooms. On request one of the two twin beds van be made up as a double king size bedroom.<br>The double room has it’s own en-suite bathroom, consisting of both an indoor and outdoor shower area. The two twin rooms share the second bathroom.<br><br>There is a fully fitted kitchen including refrigerator with freezer, stove with oven, washing machine and all needed kitchen utensils.<br><br>A real gem is the superb big veranda (32 m2). Here you have a big outdoor living space with dining table and seating area including a perfect daybed, from where you can enjoy the famous Hikkaduwa sunsets. The veranda can be closed and used as a large living space.<br><br>In the large private garden (15 meters beachfront) you have your own beautiful private swimming pool (12x24 ft). The garden gives you direct ocean access and stunning views.<br><br>As we want to be as environmental friendly as possible, we have installed a Solar Heated Hot water system (200 L).<br><br>* Generator: we have no standard generator at the moment in the Blue Peacock Beach House, but will do our utmost to supply you with one to run all electrical equipment, except the AC´s. (we managed up till now)<br><br>** WI-FI - We do have fast broadband Wi-Fi in the property. Unfortunately, it is not unlimited. Sri Lanka operates a system of download limits. Put simply, we have a monthly allowance of 90GB per month. The domestic allowance is more than enough for normal Internet use, checking emails, flights, news, etc. However, movie downloads and streaming sites will quickly eat up the allowance. If you need a higher quota, please ask the staff and they can raise the limits at your costs.<br><br>*** Normal electricity usage is covered in the rental price (up to 50 KWh / day). This is more than sufficient for normal usage. Unfortunately we have to charge excessive usage as electricity is scarce and by that very expensive in Sri Lanka. Every KWh over the daily 50 KWh will be charged with 100 SLR. At check-in and check-out the meter will be read. If there are additional costs they have to be settled before check-out."
