After almost ten years of using Airbnb, I can safely say that this is one of the best experiences we’ve ever had on the platform, and we would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone looking to book a stay in Croatia. The house itself is gorgeous, fully stocked up with quality appliances, and beautifully decorated. The garden is a dream, with a view over the ocean and full privacy from the road, including a great pool and ‘chill area’. Just outside the garden, from your own gate, you have an incredible spot for swimming in the sea - with sun loungers and the clearest blue-green water. A little piece of paradise! And finally, the host - we could not have asked for a better welcome, with a huge platter of hams, cheeses, olives and more waiting in the fridge, together with chilled wine. Plenty of fruit everywhere, and the kindest hospitality we’ve ever experienced on Airbnb. On top of that, I received a lovely extra treat for my birthday, which showed so much care and kindness. And, if you have any questions, they’re answered immediately, and we also really appreciated the flexible checkout. Just perfect! If you’re still wondering whether to book this place, please don’t hesitate - beautifully situated right next to the sea in Orebic and with everything you can possibly need, combined with the perfect host, this is a one-of-a-kind! Thank you SO much for having us.",
