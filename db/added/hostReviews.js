After almost ten years of using Airbnb, I can safely say that this is one of the best experiences we’ve ever had on the platform, and we would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone looking to book a stay in Croatia. The house itself is gorgeous, fully stocked up with quality appliances, and beautifully decorated. The garden is a dream, with a view over the ocean and full privacy from the road, including a great pool and ‘chill area’. Just outside the garden, from your own gate, you have an incredible spot for swimming in the sea - with sun loungers and the clearest blue-green water. A little piece of paradise! And finally, the host - we could not have asked for a better welcome, with a huge platter of hams, cheeses, olives and more waiting in the fridge, together with chilled wine. Plenty of fruit everywhere, and the kindest hospitality we’ve ever experienced on Airbnb. On top of that, I received a lovely extra treat for my birthday, which showed so much care and kindness. And, if you have any questions, they’re answered immediately, and we also really appreciated the flexible checkout. Just perfect! If you’re still wondering whether to book this place, please don’t hesitate - beautifully situated right next to the sea in Orebic and with everything you can possibly need, combined with the perfect host, this is a one-of-a-kind! Thank you SO much for having us.",

"commentDate": "Joined in 2018", "comment": "The Temple House Villa is a fantastic villa for a family get together. It is accurately portrayed by the host. The house staff who are there to assist, provide meals, and deal with any issues, are exceptional. The villa is located in a small local neighbourhood away from the main tourist hub. Therefore expect the normal sounds associated with village life with the odd party from nearby Villas. The host was prompt in dealing with enquiries and extremely helpful in dealing with issues. They quickly arranged a generator to provide power during government imposed electricity blackout periods of over 5 hours per day. Although, the generators only have limited use. The power cuts will be ongoing for a while so check before booking as this will impact your stay. Hopefully, the host will disclose this on the booking site. I would highly recommend the villa for a quiet get together with friends or family. It is a short 10 minute tuk tuk ride to the main tourist precinct of Hikkaduwa.",

Из минусов: - Существуют проблемы с электричеством - его отключают два раза в деньв сумме от 3 до 5 часов. Это нужно учитывать. - Вилла с участком по фото кажется больше чем на самом деле. - Расположение виллы относительно далеко от инфраструктуры. Не смотря на минусы, вилла всё равно отличная, можно брать)",

It started with the fact that we had to pay 1000 baht depositite which was not indicated in the advertisement. Furthermore, we had no privacy at all and all of a sudden both the host and the hostess were standing several times in our stay. Furthermore, we had been looking forward to the pool for at least 3 months and were only informed 2 weeks before our stay that the pool was not available. We would get a free trip for this with crabbing. This trip was not what we expected, the gentleman could not speak English and therefore was unable to contribute to us about fishing, he angry our food which was charged to us on our departure. Also, there is nothing near the air bnb and the only option as dinner is a seafood restaurant. We had ordered this food from the hostess, 180 and 150 baht for 2 dishes but later on our departure we were charged almost 500 baht.",
