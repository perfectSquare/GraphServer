The island itself is deceptively large, enjoying all day sunshine, with many shaded parts ideal for relaxing, as well as ample places to sit and eat. Great for waterspots with Kyaks, SUP board and motor boat, as well as relaxing with the hot tub and sauna. The views are spectacular in every direction, with beautiful sunsets. Tomas was a brilliant host, who made the whole experience a pleasure. We look forward to revisiting!"

Tomas was always approachable and went out of her way to give us a nice time. The best thing to do is bring enough food and drinks for the whole time, because you don't want to leave the island.

Menni has obviously made a huge effort to prepare a great experience for any guests and this shows in how organised everything was and also in attention to small details.<br><br>It was a privilege to be hosted on this dreamy island away from hectic modern life but with everything you need for fun (amazing boat and swimming), comfort (super sauna) and to still be able to work when you need to (perfect solar power and WiFi)."

It's a very rare combination of a wonderful place and an awesome host.<br><br>The Place is even more beautiful than it appears in the pictures. Centrally located in the safest part of Srinagar on the main road. The lawn is well maintained and we didn't need to step out for our morning walk and tea.<br><br>Mr Bakshi is a wonderful host , friend , naturist, guide, conversationalist ... sorry I am falling short of words. He helped us in all ways possible and made us feel comfortable. Mansoor bhai our chef took great care. Wonderful stay with my family. If the Almighty permits I will not stay anyplace else in Srinagar for my next visit. Thanks for everything."
