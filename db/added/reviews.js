The island itself is deceptively large, enjoying all day sunshine, with many shaded parts ideal for relaxing, as well as ample places to sit and eat. Great for waterspots with Kyaks, SUP board and motor boat, as well as relaxing with the hot tub and sauna. The views are spectacular in every direction, with beautiful sunsets. Tomas was a brilliant host, who made the whole experience a pleasure. We look forward to revisiting!"

It's a very rare combination of a wonderful place and an awesome host.<br><br>The Place is even more beautiful than it appears in the pictures. Centrally located in the safest part of Srinagar on the main road. The lawn is well maintained and we didn't need to step out for our morning walk and tea.<br><br>Mr Bakshi is a wonderful host , friend , naturist, guide, conversationalist ... sorry I am falling short of words. He helped us in all ways possible and made us feel comfortable. Mansoor bhai our chef took great care. Wonderful stay with my family. If the Almighty permits I will not stay anyplace else in Srinagar for my next visit. Thanks for everything."

Bedrooms were clean and the staff were there at hand to assist us with anything we required. The view of the sea and the sunsets is something I cant put a price on. I went with my huband and our two children plus my parents and all of us had a lovely time. Thank you to Patricia and Alwin."

It feels as if you have the beach to yourself as the charming wooden fence leads right onto the sand. The amenities on the property are excellent (high speed wifi, hot water, etc). The host, Patricia, and building manager were responsive and more than willing to arrange any other needs during the stay.br><br>There is honesty not much that could be added to improve the experience we had during our stay.

Right at the beach which isn't busy at this part and the seating terrace is such a great pleasure to have to watch the sea and sunset. Only tiny downside was cooker, if you'd plan on cooking plan simple meals as the gas supply isn't great and only one ring can be used and stoll takes quite long time to prep a meal.<br>But otherwise its very private, tucked away from busy road and just like true paradise with lovely staff looking after the place and pool.<br>Highly recommended and will definitely be back!"

The place was spotless, the view was amazing, and the pool and air conditioning were a great touch! We are very independent travelers, so Richy was very respectful of our space in the first two days.<br><br>On our second day we had one traveler crash the motorbike, and Richy and Fah dropped everything to pick us up and take us to the emergency room. They stayed with us the entire time to ensure our safety and bring us back. These are truly genuine and caring people!<br><br>Finally, after an injury changed our plans, Richy and Fah designed an entire third day for us that included a private boating tour through the islands (highlight of the entire two week trip through Thailand, and the captain Bang Don was an equally impressive and caring individual), followed by an amazing sunset dinner!"

They were also flexible with check-in and check-out time, which was extremely helpful. Also he came on his bike to pick up my grandfather which was an amazing gesture. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The food was also amazing. The neighborhood is very conveniently located and the listing is very quiet and peaceful! I would absolutely recommend staying there."

It's a really beautiful building and the whole place is much more spacious than it appears in the photos, and it is in really great condition. It has a diverse range of rooms in which to hang out from the spacious yet cozy living room and the large yoga room, to the sauna, and the smaller rooms in the tower.<br><br>Matt & Jamie themselves were incredibly helpful, making themselves available to answer all our questions and help with organizational tasks (e.g., setting up the carriages, making restaurant reservations) and were incredibly responsive and flexible (e.g., as we needed to change the timing on some things). All their efforts were directed to making our stay a great one and making sure things worked well. At the same time they were not in the slightest bit intrusive. They've really got the balance right.<br><br>We had a magical time at the palace. We would love to go back there if we ever have another suitable occasion to celebrate there."
