        "comment": "Per-Henriks house is amazing. Situated on an island, very quiet, fabulous views. There is a sauna house, with a deck at the water. Also a very nice place to dine and relax. A canoe is available to explore some of the enormous lake. Grocery shopping is not far by car and there are plenty restaurants in Ostersund. Beautiful waterfalls near Are and great hiking trails in the area. We had a very relaxing stay."
